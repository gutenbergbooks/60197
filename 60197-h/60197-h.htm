  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is probable that no book on any military topic published
since the outbreak of the present war has excited an interest and
comment in European military circles equal to that produced by
the publication of Captain Laffargue’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Etude sur l’attaque dans la
période actuelle de la guerre</span></i>. It is, in fact, the first publication
from the pen of a military man dealing with the general and
detailed aspects of the tactics of the attack in trench warfare that
has come to our attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>The methods of training of infantry units for this class of
warfare and the degree of careful preparation necessary for the
attainment of any measure of success are among the most
important features of Captain Laffargue’s study. The comparison
which he makes between the conduct in battle of
two regiments of very different quality, brings out very clearly
the difference between real infantry and the cannon-fodder
variety which is too often considered adequate for war purposes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact that this study was so highly thought of by General
Joffre that he caused it to be published to the French Army before
it was given out for general publication, speaks for its excellence
more eloquently than any commendation which could otherwise
be bestowed upon it.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The attack at the present period has become one of siege
warfare. We must accept it as it is, study it, tax our wits
to find special means to prepare effectively for it and to
orient the instruction of troops entirely with this in view.</p>

<p class='c007'>The attack on all points of our front consists in breaking through
several lines of defense upon a depth of about three kilometres
and in preventing the enemy from holding on further back on new
lines already prepared or merely improvized.</p>

<p class='c007'>The attack is therefore an immense, unlimited, simultaneous
assault on all points of the front of attack, furiously pushed straight
to the front until all the enemy’s defenses are broken through.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The characteristic of this attack is that it is not progressive but is
an assault of a single rush; it must be accomplished in one day as
otherwise the enemy reforms, and the defense, with terrible engines of
sudden destruction, will later recover its supremacy over the attack,
which cannot quickly enough regain the mastery of this consuming
fire.</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>The whole series of frightful defenses cannot be nibbled at successively;
they must be swallowed whole at one stroke with one
decision.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore, the fight is an unlimited assault. In order to attempt
the assault, what is necessary?</p>

<p class='c007'>Assaulting troops—and all troops are far from being assaulting
troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>An overwhelming superiority of fire all the time and not only
at the moment of assault.</p>

<p class='c007'>The possibility of rushing forth from a line of shelter a short
distance from the enemy, a condition equally to be sought for in
any other phase of the combat.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order that the assault may be unlimited, the sacrifice being
resolved upon, it must be pushed through to a finish and the
enemy drowned under successive waves, <em>calculating, however, that
infantry units disappear in the furnace of fire like handfuls of straw</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it possible to pierce the enemy’s lines? I firmly believe so
since the 9th of May<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. But before that, this hypothesis seemed
to me a mad temerity. I had taken part in the Battle of Nancy
and in the Battle of Ypres where it appears that the Germans,
after a terrifying deluge of heavy projectiles during interminable
days, tried to break through us, which I certainly did not think
possible, seeing the paltry and easily shattered efforts of their
infantry. In considering the forces put into action which did not
succeed in making us yield a foot, I believed in the inviolability
of the lines of defense. On the 9th of May, by a single dash, our
first wave submerged in one hour all the enemy’s first-line defenses
to a depth of several kilometres.</p>

<p class='c007'>The assault is extremely murderous; it is an implacable struggle
in which one or the other must fall and in which the engines of
combat not destroyed beforehand often make terrible havoc in
the ranks of unprotected assaulting troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>He who risks his life and does not wish to die but to succeed,
becomes at times ingenious. That is why I, who was part of the
human canister for more than nine months, have set about to
consider the means of saving the inestimable existence of so many
humble comrades, or at least to figure out how the sacrifice of their
lives may result in victory.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>II.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Preparation of the Attack.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>FORMS OF THE GERMAN DEFENSIVE ORGANIZATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The German defensive organizations, as well as I have been
able to establish, appear to be in general as follows:<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>1. A continuous line of trenches over the whole front, comprising
on a limited depth two or three trenches, joined by numerous
communicating trenches (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaux</span></i>), and separated by 100 to 300
metres, each one often protected by a wire entanglement.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Centers of resistance, comprising large villages, woods, or
immense field works, consisting of a network of trenches which are
very strongly organized and in which machine guns under cupolas
as well as pieces of artillery are mounted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such are, for example, the Labyrinth and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ouvrages Blancs</span></i> of
Neuville. These centers of resistance are separated by intervals
of 800 to 1,500 metres; they mutually flank each other, and their
intervals are generally guarded by closed works.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. A second line of defense, which is not always continuous.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>PREPARATION BY THE ARTILLERY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In order to attack with minimum loss, the infantry-requires
that the artillery in its preparation carry through the following
program:</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>a</em>) <em>Destroy the wire entanglements.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>b</em>) <em>Neutralize or destroy the defenders of the trenches.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>c</em>) <em>Prevent the artillery from coming into action.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>d</em>) <em>Prevent the bringing up of reserves.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>e</em>) <em>Destroy the machine guns as soon as they reveal their positions.</em></p>

<h4 class='c012'>(<em>a</em>) <em>Destruction of the Wire Entanglement.</em></h4>

<p class='c011'>The 75 produces sufficient breaches in the wire entanglements
for the infantry to get through; in order to accomplish this, each
piece remains laid on the same point of the entanglement. But the
infantry should not expect the complete and continuous destruction
of the entanglement: that would require too many projectiles.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>(<em>b</em>) <em>Neutralization or Destruction of the Defenders of the Trenches.</em></h4>

<p class='c011'>The Germans, whenever they can, dig very deep and well protected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>shelters, in the interior of which they crowd themselves.
The 75 has no effect on these shelters, and the infantry of the attack,
who are delighted to see the parapets, the sand bags, planks,
posts, etc., fly into the air as if pulverized by the ripping detonations,
are stupefied on finding themselves greeted by a heavy fire
as soon as they start out of their trenches. In consequence of
this, the infantry is convinced that whenever the enemy has been
able to construct deep shelters, an assault is certain massacre, in
spite of the prodigious expenditure of 75’s, unless other and more
powerful means of destruction have been employed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The aerial torpedo, on the contrary, seems to produce terrifying
effects on the defenders of the trenches; it has also considerable
destructive effect. This power is not always sufficient to break in
the shelter caverns, but it completely knocks to pieces the firing
trenches, produces cave-ins, blocks the openings of the shelters,
and thus walls in the occupants. By its formidable explosion, the
extraordinary effects of its blast, and the concussion that it induces
in the ground, it annihilates all energy in the defenders, who at
every instant think their last minute has come.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the sector of attack of my company on the 9th of May, a
portion of the trenches in front of the 3d and 4th Sections was
severely pounded by the fire of the 75 and especially by the aerial
torpedoes, while the remainder of the trenches in front of the 1st
and 2d Sections suffered only from the preparation by the 75.
The difference was remarkable. While the 1st and 2d Sections,
hardly out of their parallel, saw the enemy rise up and melted
away under his suddenly opened rifle fire, and especially under
that of a machine gun, the 4th Section reached the German trench,
crossed it without hindrance, and continued on its way. As for
the 3d Section, it had been received by only a few shots and had
crossed the first trench in one rush, when it received some shots in
the back. Returning to the rear, the men found several dozen
Germans crouching in the deep shelters, absolutely all in and crying
for mercy. The cannonade had ceased, and in spite of the violent
fusillade cracking outside announcing an attack, they had not
budged. Only a few had the courage to shoot in the back from
an opening the French soldiers who passed close by.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conversations with numerous infantry officers have definitely
convinced me that the heaviest bombardment by 75’s alone is
ineffective against trenches organized during a long period. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>heavy artillery has too much dispersion, while the aerial torpedo,
besides its considerable destructive and demoralizing effects, is
very accurate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the preparation on the zone of the first trenches may be
made largely by means of aerial torpedoes. But it is necessary
that the torpedo guns be placed close together in a continuous
line (at least one to every 100 metres of trenches) and that each
one have its zone clearly defined.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Arras, these guns were not very numerous, and their preparation
was consequently only partial; in trying to pound several lines
of trenches at the same time, large spaces remained outside the
effects of their action, while certain corners were entirely
demolished.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the artillery depots, very numerous gun crews should be
organized beforehand for the torpedo guns, and not date only
from the day before and be at their first try out, as at Arras.</p>

<p class='c007'>The aerial torpedo, terrorizing the defenders in the interior of
their shelters, already neutralizes them in part; but the best plan
of eliminating the enemy is to destroy him. In order to destroy
him, it is necessary to force him to expose himself, to oblige him
to come out to become the prey of the iron hail. For this there
are several means:</p>

<p class='c007'>Have the infantry advance during the preparation by the
artillery;</p>

<p class='c007'>Simulate the attack;</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally a third method that can be transferred from the domain
of fox hunting to that of the war with Germany: smoke him out.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first plan is not applicable from first trenches as they are
too near the enemy; we shall speak of this again.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to simulate an attack, interrupt the artillery fire
suddenly and <em>open rifle fire with a great deal of shouting</em>; the enemy
hurries out immediately to his combat positions; after several
minutes’ waiting, a violent rafale of 75. This is what we did from
time to time when we wished to make the Germans come out into
their trenches so that we could demolish some of them by artillery
fire. At Arras, there was a brusque interruption of artillery fire
for ten minutes, but it was an absolute and impressive silence.
The Germans were not misled by it, and when the interruption for
the real attack came with its fusillade and noise, they manned
their trenches to meet it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>As a third scheme <em>we have suffocating grenades and cartridges</em>,
which irritate the eyes and produce tears and render the neighborhood
of the spot where they fall untenable for several minutes.
We could also have projectiles of larger dimensions, containing
materials giving off heavy, suffocating gas. Thus this gas would
creep over the ground, fall into the bottom of the trenches, and
enter the shelters, driving out the occupants, who would then
come under the fire of the high-explosive shells. This gas, being,
moreover, only suffocating, would afterwards have the advantage
of not incommoding our soldiers in their trench or during the
attack.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the heavy artillery may be replaced very advantageously
by torpedoes for the preparation on the continuous line of trenches,
it may be employed effectively against the centers of resistance,
where its more concentrated effects will not produce the simply
superficial disorganization of the 75, which leaves the cupolas of the
machine guns intact.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most important part to destroy in the centers of resistance
<em>are the edges</em>, for the attack breaks through easily enough in the
intermediate spaces but immediately comes under flanking fire.
Moreover, a center of resistance whose borders are disorganized, becomes
a harmless island, the attack of which by main strength
would be terribly costly; for instance, the Labyrinth, Neuville-Saint-Vaast,
Carency, which were passed by in less than an hour
by groups arriving at the Cemetery of Neuville, at the La Folie
Woods, and at the first houses of Souchez. <em>Therefore try especially
to neutralize the borders</em> by concentrating on them the fire of batteries
suitably placed with a view to following the attack on the
intervals. If one could put a <em>veil over the centers of resistance</em>
to isolate them and obstruct the view of the flanking works, the
problem would be partly solved. It would then be necessary
to have projectiles giving off large quantities of heavy smoke, which
would spread out over the ground and dissipate very slowly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The intermediate works in the intervals are easy to take because
of their small dimensions. On the 9th of May, they were generally
found knocked to pieces.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>(<em>c</em>) <em>Preparation against Artillery.</em></h4>

<p class='c011'><em>The infantry urgently demands that the hostile artillery be put
out of action before the attack.</em> If the enemy artillery gets into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>action, the troops, crowded into the trenches, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaux</span></i>,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and parallels,
have to suffer a painful bombardment, which causes losses and
obliges everyone to hunt cover—an inauspicious attitude for
troops which will have shortly to rush forward. Communications
become difficult, the telephonic connections are broken, everyone
gets nervous and perturbed. On the attack proper, artillery fire
has an extraordinary disturbing effect; the bullets of the rifles
and machine guns cause disorder by the sudden and serious losses
they occasion, but the shells spread confusion almost solely by the
sight and the crash of explosions. On the 9th of May, we hardly
received any shells at all, not one during the attack itself, and this
contributed in a large degree to the magnificent <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élan</span></i> of the first
attacking waves.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Langemarck on the contrary, in a night attack on the
trenches on the 4th of December, the unsilenced hostile artillery
bombarded our trenches of departure, and I had my second
section dispersed through being saluted by a rafale of shrapnel
that had put the chief of section and the file closers, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de
combat</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to silence the hostile artillery, it seems that, knowing
the probable emplacement of the batteries, it would be necessary
suddenly and without warning to let loose on them a deluge of
fire. The personnel of these batteries not being continually at
their firing positions, this sudden tempest would surprise them and
keep them inside their shelters. In the midst of the confusion,
the fire of the batteries which try to get into action is much disturbed,
impeded, and frequently interrupted. On the 9th of May,
the hostile artillery must have been completely surprised and
literally stupefied during the whole morning, for they abandoned
their infantry. Only a few pieces fired some hasty shots.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to render the emplacements of the batteries completely
untenable, they might be overwhelmed with shells giving off
clouds of smoke and also asphyxiating shells; by this means the
cannoneers would be obliged to quit their pieces or serve them
under extremely difficult conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The aviators hovering over the hostile lines could complete the
preparation by indicating by means of luminous balls to the
batteries on watch the hostile batteries not yet silenced or which
have come into action.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h4 class='c012'>(<em>d</em>) <em>Preparation against Reinforcements and Reserves.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In the second and third trenches, the garrison does not generally
occupy its firing positions; it is obliged to get to them in case of
attack. As long as the artillery preparation lasts, it does not budge
from the shelters; but as soon as the artillery ceases its fire, the
garrison hastily mans the positions. It is necessary then for the
artillery to extend its fire to the second and third lines and to continue
this fire while the infantry rushes the first line. The approach
trenches and their junctions should especially be swept. This
has, moreover, the advantage of keeping crouched in their holes the
defenders of the first line, who are not reassured by sensing the
compact sheaves of the terrible explosive passing close over their
heads. The preparation on the second line of defense is absolutely
identical.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is next necessary to cut the battlefield in two and isolate the
zone of the first and second lines of defence, constantly manned by
the troops near their combat positions, from the zone of cantonment.
It is a matter of establishing an insuperable barrier. A
barrier solely of ordinary shell fire is extremely expensive. The
Germans have more simply solved the question by establishing a
barrier of asphyxiating gas. They have employed this extremely
effective scheme, it seems, at Bagatelle in the Argonne, on the
30th of June and the 1st and 2d of July.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bombardment of the cantonment by long-range heavy guns
throws disorder among the troops who are at rest. Suddenly
surprised in the most profound quietude, the alarm causes all
the more flurry and demoralization. Obliged to follow roads
sprinkled here and there with fragments, they thus arrive diminished
in number on the field of battle.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>(<em>e</em>) <em>Destruction of Machine Guns.</em></h4>

<p class='c011'>The weapon which inflicts the heaviest losses on infantry is the
machine gun, which uncovers itself suddenly and in a few seconds
lays out the assailants by ranks. It is therefore absolutely necessary
to destroy them before the attack or have the means of putting
them out of action as soon as they disclose themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the days which precede the attack, a minute study of
the hostile trenches should be made by the infantry officers who
have to attack them, in concert with the artillery officers who
pound the same trenches; their study should bear especially upon
the emplacements of the hostile machine guns.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>The machine-gun emplacements are recognized in the continuous
trenches by the low horizontal loopholes much larger than
ordinary loopholes. They are generally quite easily recognized.
Occasionally the machine guns are in a little separate work which
is quite characteristic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even when they cannot be directly observed, machine-gun
emplacements should be pre-supposed in locations such as the
following:</p>

<p class='c007'>1.  In a re-entrant in the line.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_b_013a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'>2.  On the second line, particularly when it presents an elevated
position permitting a tier of fire over the first line.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_b_013b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'>3.  Squarely in front to obtain a flanking fire; in this case, they
are found in a small <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyau</span></i> (branch trench) which leaves the principal
trench, and it is very difficult to see them from the front.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_b_013c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'>Thus, in front of La Targette, in studying the position in profile
and having moved considerably toward the right for that purpose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>I discovered a machine-gun emplacement which completely
enfiladed the front of the German trenches for 600 metres.</p>

<p class='c007'>One generally believes he recognizes a very large number of
machine-gun emplacements; but it is infinitely better to mark
the position of too many than to overlook one of them; moreover,
the Germans have in their defensive organization an unsuspected
number of them.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Means of Destroying the Machine Guns.</em>—<em>Machine Guns of the
Trenches.</em>—In the course of preparation by artillery, a very distinct
part of the program is reserved for the destruction of the
machine-gun nests. The destruction of the machine guns should
not be commenced as soon as they have been located, that is to
say, often several days before the final preparations, for the enemy
would have ample time to shift them. The 75 is employed to
destroy the machine guns. Unfortunately, on account of the
dispersion, it does not perfectly fulfil its rôle; its shots often fall to
one side and a great number of them are often necessary to find
exactly the small space that holds the machine gun.</p>

<p class='c007'>I recollect that before the attack of May 9, I fretted with impatience
and went continually to find the artillery observer, as I saw
an accursed rectangular loophole obstinately remain intact up to
the end. When we started forward, fire burst out from this loophole,
and two sections were wiped out.</p>

<p class='c007'>To destroy these machine guns, there would be needed not only
cannon placed at 1,500 metres, which have many other tasks, but
cannon placed in the trench itself. The <em>mountain 80</em> seems to
realize the desired conditions of effectiveness and mobility.
Hidden in the trench before the preparation, it unmasks itself
during that operation; it takes under direct fire like a rifle all the
machine-gun shelters successively, occupying itself with those
alone and not leaving them until they are all completely out of
action.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Destruction of Machine Guns that may be set up outside the
Trenches.</em>—On the 9th of May, the survivors of my company and
of the adjoining company, about eighty men, arrived at 11 o’clock<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
about 200 metres from the cemetery of Neuville-Saint-Vaast.
The cemetery being unoccupied, the field of battle seemed void of
Germans. In the distance, the batteries were fleeing. Two machine
guns remained in the mill; this was the only resistance over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>an immense space, but it was sufficient. Impossible for my men
to advance; we signal the fact with difficulty to the artillery, which
from this time on is under open field conditions; it opens fire a
long time afterwards and mistakes the objective. Then before
the eyes of our furious men, abandoned by all because they were
too far to the front, the cemetery fills up with Germans. Four
hours afterwards, the 146th appears on the field and is mowed
down by the machine guns; the next day the 229th succeeds it;
new repetition with a slight and extremely costly advance.</p>

<p class='c007'>With these machine guns revealing themselves thus without
our being able to foresee their emplacement, and taking up positions
to stop our progress in a region no longer familiar to us, we
must have the means of suppressing them instantly. The field
artillery is too far away; communication hardly exists after
passing beyond the extremity of the telephone lines. The question
is of the greatest importance and merits study. It would be
absolutely necessary that the first waves of attack be followed,
after the taking of the first lines of trenches, by light guns, the
37 for example, drawn by their cannoneers. These independent
crews would be all eyes and ears to discover the machine guns and
destroy them immediately. There are enough officers or noncommissioned
officers of artillery to command them intelligently.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>III.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Form of Attack.</span><a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>To create a complete gap, it is necessary:</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>a</em>) <em>To take the first line of the hostile defense (zone of the first
trenches and centers of resistance)</em>;</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>b</em>) <em>To take the second line of defense</em>;</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>c</em>) <em>To prevent the enemy from reestablishing a barrier by the
aid of reinforcements brought up in haste beyond the zone already
fortified.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>To overcome successively these difficulties, one must have:</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>a</em>) A first line of attack composed of several waves of assault
with (as an element of preparation) a formidable artillery (field,
heavy, and torpedo guns) minutely regulated.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>b</em>) A second line of attack as strong as the first, except perhaps
in front of the centers of resistance, sent straight to the front all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>in one piece exactly like the first line. The same precise and
effective artillery preparation is not here present, but it is compensated
for by groups of light guns and machine guns destined
rapidly to destroy all resistance. Accompanying batteries (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">batteries
d’accompagnement</span></i>) start as soon as the first trenches are taken.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>c</em>) A reserve without initial assignment, destined to reinforce
any point and conquer any irreducible or hindering resistance.
This reserve is entirely at the disposition of the superior commander,
while the first and second lines are no longer in his hands
after they are in their parallel of departure. On the 9th of May,
this reserve was made up of the troops which should have normally
composed the second line of attack, which did not exist. This
explains the disastrous delay of its engagement, which was furthermore
very hesitating, because it tried to maneuver before having
broken through and waited for the mêlée to clear away in order to
maneuver.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<em>d</em>) Cavalry, auto-cannon, auto-machine guns, battalions of
infantry on automobiles with pioneer crews to clear the roads.—Large
units, ready to commence new combats, capable of being
brought up within two or three hours.—<em>Do not, after the hole has
been pierced, depend any longer upon the regiments who made it.</em></p>

<h3 class='c010'>RÔLE OF THE FIRST LINE.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a></h3>

<h4 class='c012'><em>Its Method of Action.</em></h4>

<p class='c011'>The first line is composed of two or three waves. The features
of the assault vary according to the distance to be crossed in
getting at the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Distance Less than 100 Metres.</em>—The first wave, composed of
entire companies in line, the men at half-pace interval, rushes
to the assault without pause as soon as the artillery fire ceases.
It should endeavor to reach the enemy before he can get out of his
shelters. It does not generally have to fire, except perhaps at the
last moment in order to cross the entanglement if the enemy opens
fire (see second case).</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Distance Greater than 100 Metres.</em>—Attack by waves of companies,
in which those in front are divided into two parts:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. A line of skirmishers at 5 paces, formed either by one section
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>deployed or by groups of skirmishers furnished by each section
(calm and resolute men).</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Fifty metres behind comes the line of attack, men in one rank,
elbow to elbow or at one pace; the company and section<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a> commanders
in front of the line; four metres behind the line of attack,
the rank formed by the file closers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this case, one cannot count on surprising the enemy; he will
open a more or less violent fire, especially during the crossing of
the wire entanglement. It is very illusory to imagine that any
company is stoical enough to allow itself to be fired on at point
blank without replying when it distinctly sees the enemy; it will
be necessary to open fire, and this will throw the assaulting line
into disorder.</p>

<p class='c007'>The thin line of skirmishers is intended to give this protection
by fire in order that the line of attack may keep its elbow-to-elbow
formation without firing until almost the last.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Neuville-Saint-Vaast, I was obliged personally to act as
a skirmisher, and I have since then strongly felt that something was
lacking in our line of attack. We arrived at the first entanglement
at 80 metres from the enemy without firing, but there on
account of the violence of the adverse fire, our fusillade broke out.
I myself recall that I marched straight ahead under the protection
of my rifle. Every time a “flat cap” raised up and aimed at me,
I threw the rifle to my shoulder rapidly; my shot came near enough
to make him duck; I profited by this short respite to advance into
the wire or dash ahead some 20 metres, always watching and
firing whenever a “flat cap” reappeared. Thus, emptying the
magazine on the march, I was able to mount the parapet of the
German trench without having permitted the enemy to fire a
single aimed shot at me. If the man who marches unprotected
in the spaces swept by bullets scorns the danger, the one who is
sheltered is inclined to exaggerate toward the side of protection,
and the men who are in the trenches when the bullets pass cannot
keep from instinctively ducking. It is a sensation which the
attack should take advantage of.</p>

<p class='c007'>The skirmishers should be calm and resolute men, and good shots
(often old reserve soldiers, well seasoned and less susceptible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>of losing their nerve and intent upon preserving their own lives).</p>

<p class='c007'>They should each march upon a particular point of the hostile
trench and watch it closely. They open fire only when they get the
order from the company commander marching between the two
echelons.</p>

<p class='c007'>This manner of making the assault strongly resembles that
brought out by De Wet in “Three Years of War.” It is the individual
assault where each soldier shows himself as a real fighter.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The March on the Line of Attack.</em>—Each echelon starts out successively
at a single bound and moves at a walk (even in cadence,
if it were possible). It is curious to observe how much this pace
conduces to cold resolution and fierce scorn of the adversary.
At Neuville, <em>all units instinctively started at a walk</em>. Afterwards
take the double time at slow cadence, in order to maintain the
cohesion; make several rushes, if necessary, of 80 to 100 metres.
They should not be multiplied, at the risk of breaking the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élan</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a great effort has been made to scorn the fire of the
adversary, it should not be destroyed by a change to an attitude
signifying fear.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 60 metres from the enemy, break into charge.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The Alignment.</em>—To march in line is a capital point, the importance
of which one must have experienced in tragic moments
to tell how prodigious is its influence. Moreover, the march in
line is as old as war itself. The alignment holds each in his
place, carries along those who hesitate, holds back the enthusiasts,
and gives to everyone the warm and irresistible feeling of mutual
confidence. At Neuville, we marched at first at a walk, then
at a slow double time, aligned as on parade. I constantly heard
behind me through the rattling of the machine guns, the epic,
splendid shout of supreme encouragement running all along the
line, “Keep in line! Keep in line!” down to the humble
reservist, C—, who in spite of the bullets making gaps all about in
the ranks, kept all of his young and agitated comrades on the
line.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus rushing like a wall, we were irresistible.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Crossing the Wire Entanglements.</em>—From the moment the entanglement
is reached, the period of charge and individual combat
begins. The men can no longer be kept from firing; each one
tries to protect himself with his own rifle.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Neuville, we arrived at a first entanglement at 80 metres
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>from the trenches almost in line and without firing. At the
entanglement we lay down, and fire was opened; each one crossed
the entanglement individually, lay down on the other side, and
recommenced firing. The line reformed without interruption of
fire. I then wished to cease firing in order to charge, but they
did not hear me. Then I stood up, ran alone toward the enemy,
and seeing me thus, the company immediately arose and dashed
across the second entanglement.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Taking the Other Trenches.</em>—The first trench taken, it should be
cleaned out, not a man capable of doing harm should be left
behind; it will not do to leave to others, for instance to the grenadiers,
the task of destroying those who can still harm us. At
Neuville, we crossed the first trench in one rush and marched on
without stopping; it was then that we were shot at from behind
and obliged to turn back to massacre them all.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first trench conquered, the line should be reformed lying
down ten metres beyond the trench. Each man arriving on this
new line should open fire against the defenders of the second
trench. When the line is reformed, it should start the attack
again as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following trenches are crossed without interruption, always
advancing.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the first wave, <em>there is no limit</em>; let it go through as far as
possible. On the 9th of May, the first line ran without stopping
as far as the cemetery of Neuville, La Folie Woods, and the first
houses of Souchez.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second wave should start forward at the moment the first
line reaches the hostile trenches. If it starts sooner, it will unite
with the first at the entanglement and be involved in the fight for
the first trench; it will be broken up prematurely, and from the
moment that it is no longer a separate mass, it cannot be considered
as a reinforcement.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the first wave drives straight ahead, and can do nothing
against the surprises of the enemy, the second and third waves,
warned by what happens to the first, can thus take certain
precautions without diminishing their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élan</span></i>, such as obliquing the
sections that would be exposed to the fire of machine guns not
yet out of action.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reinforcement by successive waves of entire companies
leads to a vexatious mixture of units. It is necessary that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>surviving officers and noncommissioned officers group around
them men of their own company but not miscellaneous units.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><em>Instruction of the First Line.</em></h4>

<p class='c011'>The assault being the most severe phase of the combat, it is
necessary, in order to face it and push it through, that the will of
each individual be transformed largely by habits and reflexes.
Therefore, hold each day an assault exercise over ground which
resembles in detail that over which the real assault will have
to be made.</p>

<p class='c007'>The points which should be borne in mind are as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The Alignment.</em>—Be particularly strict on this question; its
extreme importance is recognized. See that the line is extremely
well dressed during the execution of the rushes.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The Charge.</em>—The company, kept in line, is thus led to a short
distance from the enemy and there released. Then all together
along the whole line, lower the bayonets to the height of the waist;
this has an extremely impressive effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The charge should be frenzied and furious, and this the men
should well understand.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The File Closers.</em>—The file closers should form a rank four metres
behind the line, repeating the commands, watching especially the
alignment, and maintaining each man in his place by calling to
him by name. One can hardly realize the effectiveness of these
personal observations in the midst of the bullets. We have no
file closers; our noncommissioned officers have a general tendency
to run out in front like the bravest soldiers to get into the individual
fight, forgetting their men; their training and duties as file closers
should receive constant attention during the exercises in the
assault.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Taking the Next Trenches.</em>—<em>Pursuit over Free Ground.</em>—Generally
in assaulting exercises, everything stops after the first trench is
taken; everyone is out of breath, and only a few men here and there,
generally noncommissioned officers, try to push on shouting, but
soon, being absolutely alone, they have to lie down panting and
spent. This is what always happens in our battalion exercises.</p>

<p class='c007'>The exercise means nothing unless there is impressed on the
mind of everyone the deep-rooted idea of routing all the defenders
in one sweep. Each man should know that after having crossed
the first trench, he should go on a few paces, lie down, open fire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>on the hostile groups who occupy the second trench, then get
ready to start forward as before, and charge again with the same
vigor in spite of fatigue.</p>

<p class='c007'>We always did this in our exercises, and it was done the same
way on the 9th of May. I know men who were shot in the back
by German wounded after having crossed the first trench to reform
beyond it as had been prescribed. In spite of frightful gaps, a
line of men kneeling was, however, reformed beyond the conquered
trench and by its fire drove the defenders of the second trench back
into their holes.</p>

<p class='c007'>As long as there remains a trench to conquer, <em>prohibit absolutely
all advance through the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaux</span></em> (communicating trenches); always
reform in line. But the trenches having been taken, the zone of
open ground is reached where the enemy will try to reestablish
some resistance here and there; it will be necessary to advance with
more precaution <em>and to try and creep through inside his lines and
throw him into disorder by surprise</em>. Form in each section patrols,
each one having at least one noncommissioned officer; they should
be trained to start out spontaneously as soon as the defenses of
the enemy have been passed, and to spread out in front of the
company, trying to creep through the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaux</span></i> to get possession of
important points without being seen. These patrols, equipped
with revolvers and grenades, should be practised in exercises
involving combats in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaux</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Skirmish Formation.</em>—In close combat, men fight much more
by shooting at point blank and very often from the hip than with
the bayonet. The man should therefore be trained to use his
rifle in close fighting.</p>

<p class='c007'>First teach him to watch that part of the parapet and the
loopholes on which he marches in order to forestall the shots of the
enemy; then to aim rapidly, throwing the piece to the shoulder
to get the first shot at the enemy who is aiming at him; begin by
bringing up the piece and aiming slowly, and then increase the
rapidity of movement; the man should observe each time where
his line of sight strikes. He should have his magazine filled for
hand-to-hand fighting and know how to refill it lying down or
while running. Thanks to this precaution, after having emptied
my magazine at the first entanglement, I was able to hold my own
with full magazine against three Germans who got in my way.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>RÔLE OF THE SECOND LINE, THE “REINFORCEMENTS.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a></h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c012'><em>Its Method of Action.</em></h4>

<p class='c011'>The most important question concerning the penetration of the
enemy’s line is perhaps the action of the reinforcements (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">renforts</span></i>),
and as that action has always fallen short, we have never been
able to attain the victory which has seemed so nearly within our
reach.</p>

<p class='c007'>The inertia of the second line and its expenditure without effect
arise from two causes.</p>

<p class='c007'>To take the first trenches is a task relatively easy; the artillery
preparation is minutely regulated; the terrain is well known, and
the attack is therefore free and open and is pushed through
without reservation. But when the first lines have been crossed,
one enters thenceforth into the domain of the unknown, one is on
the lookout for ambushes and apprehends an unexpected trap at
each step; this disquietude slows up the march and quickly transforms
into a surprise the least activity of the enemy. A resistance
which starts up suddenly intimidates and paralyses the second
line immediately, because the fear of the enemy leads to exaggeration
of his strength and the mental disturbance prevents locating
and estimating him rapidly. In addition, the reinforcements have
during long hours of waiting been subjected to a very demoralizing
artillery fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these causes so influence the second line that when it goes
into action, it attacks without spirit and soon stops.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second cause arises, as I have previously mentioned, from a
faulty conception of the action of the second line.</p>

<p class='c007'>In place of having a second line of attack analogous to the first,
coming into the fight in one body and marching straight on to the
assigned objectives, the superior commander uses these troops as
reinforcements, which he throws in at the point where he judges
their employment necessary. <em>Now it is impossible for this commander
to see clearly in the mêlée, he must wait a long time for the
situation to unravel, and as it is necessary for him to be properly
informed to send in his reinforcements opportunely, they always arrive
too late.</em> Having generally received orders which are ill defined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and not having been able to prepare beforehand for the rôle
that falls to them, their attitude is necessarily weak and hesitating.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is absolutely necessary to keep pushing on in a brutal, preconceived,
and almost unintelligent manner until the last link is
broken, otherwise hostile reinforcements will suddenly arrive and
shatter the supreme effort.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Choice of Troops for the Second Line.</em>—This line being subject
to the severe trial of bombardment and of the rifle fire directed on
the first line sweeping the ground behind, and being obliged to act
with as much decision as the troops of the first line, it should be
particularly well officered and be composed of troops of excellent
spirit; now it often happens that less reliable troops are placed in
this line, and far from pushing the first line forward, they stop
short of it.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Location of the Troops of the Second Line. The Moment for
Putting Them in Action.</em>—During the preparation, the troops of the
second line await their turn in the shelters which open into the
approach <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaux</span></i>. It would be very advantageous if they could
be placed as close as possible to the parallel of departure<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a> in
order to profit from the more or less complete protection against
hostile artillery fire which comes from being close to the hostile
trenches; but in general this will not be possible, except where the
German and French trenches are separated by a considerable distance;
in this case, there will be enough space between the parallel
of departure and the old trench to install several support trenches.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>When the first line has entirely departed, the units of the second
line take their place in the parallel of departure and form there.
<em>While not waiting there too long, it is absolutely necessary that the
second-line troops entirely separate their effort from the effort of the
troops preceding them.</em> They should start forward when the latter
have almost taken the first zone of defense. A premature departure
would mix their action with that of the first waves, and
they would be absorbed in the same combat. Thus prematurely
consumed and broken up, they would be incapable of continuing
their action and would add nothing to the effort of the preceding
troops.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Taking the Formation for Combat.</em>—The units of the second line
should take their combat formation from the parallel of departure
and from there be oriented on a well fixed objective; in fact, they
risk coming unexpectedly under fire and should be ready for it at
any time. There is, moreover, a reason of a moral order for it,
which has been very often tested out. When taking the formation
for combat, that is to say, when getting ready to fight the enemy
before even having seen him, it seems that each one becomes
imbued with a cold and silent resolution, which is alone irresistible.
Taking formation under the pressure of danger, however, seems
more like a check, and there comes out of it a demoralizing sensation
of sudden fear and disorder.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Formation.</em>—The conditions which the formation should fulfil
are the following: to be supple in order to adapt itself immediately
to the exigencies of the situation; to be as invulnerable as possible
so that it may escape the effects of a sudden destructive fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a company, the formation seems to be that of two lines
about 150 metres apart, the skirmishers three or four paces apart,
the company commander marching between the two lines so that
he can see what the first line sees without being entirely involved
in its combat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The march has been generally conducted in small columns at
deploying intervals, as it seems that this formation is the more
supple and permits of a better utilization of the terrain. This is
true only in time of peace, but in war one must deploy a long time
before the bullets arrive.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>March and Use of Ground.</em>—Each company marches <em>at a walk</em>
straight toward its objective and <em>in line</em> as long as it is not subjected
to direct fire; it thus avoids the irregularities which arise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>from the anxiety to make use of the ground, when from now on,
only one anxiety should prevail, that of routing the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is generally a tendency to try to make use of the hostile
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaux</span></i> and trenches as lines of advance. Even if they should permit
approach by surprise and without loss, they divide up the company
and break the formations for attack; furthermore an extraordinary
difficulty is experienced in leaving them when the bullets whistle
and the moment comes for getting out on the open field.</p>

<p class='c007'>I shall always remember Fonquevillers, where I persisted in
following with my company a narrow approach which brought me
near the enemy, and I know that we had much trouble in leaving it.
I have often thought since that it would have been preferable to
take a combat position in a hollow road a little further to the rear
parallel to the enemy’s front, at 400 metres.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Combat of Units of the Second Line.</em>—The units of the first line,
having made their effort, have been finally stopped on the whole
front by a series of resistances. The troops of the second line
have received as their mission only the two following objects:</p>

<p class='c007'>To master a well-defined zone up to a certain point;</p>

<p class='c007'>To master the borders of a center of resistance on the flank of
troops that have pushed into the intervals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eventually they may at certain points receive the order to
throw back a counter-offensive and to pursue.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the troops of the second line arrive in the proximity of
the troops of the first line who have been stopped, there should
be no idea of maneuvering nor of consultation, but as in the case
of the first enemy trench, they must carry through <em>the assault
without hesitation</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two cases are presented according to the distance that separates
the fractions of the halted first line from the hostile resistance:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Distance less than 200 metres:</p>

<p class='c007'>If the stopped first line can maintain itself at the limit of its
progression, it is generally not in an open field. Its line will serve
as a parallel of departure for the units of the second line. These
units at first try to reach the line of shelter where they will be
formed. Their assaulting formation results from the march
formation, and the waves will be composed of half companies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first wave rushes out of cover at the double to at least half
the distance and opens fire; fire being opened, the second wave
rushes <em>in line</em> and carries along the first.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Here the firing cannot be prevented, as artillery support, now
faulty, has to be replaced by rifle fire, to which is joined the fire
of machine guns and light cannon, which alone can make possible
so fearful an assault.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Distance more than 200 metres—Progression and Assault:</p>

<p class='c007'>The new difficulty is to build up at assaulting distance from the
enemy a line of assault in a sort of parallel of departure.</p>

<p class='c007'>To arrive at assaulting distance, advance by thin lines formed by
halving the skirmish lines already deployed; these lines, at least
100 metres apart, advance successively by alternate rushes, then
unite on the line designated as the starting point for the assault.</p>

<p class='c007'>A natural parallel of departure may exist or may partially
exist, or it may not exist at all. In the second case, the line of
shelters must be adapted, and in the third case it must be created
in order to be able to stay a few moments at a short distance
from the enemy without being destroyed. To facilitate this
extremely difficult and dangerous construction, it is a good thing
to have each man fill a sand bag at the last shelter and put in
some stones, which, while not bulky, stop the bullets. Each man
makes his rushes with his sand bag, which protects him partially
during the halts. Having reached the line fixed upon for the
parallel, this sand bag serves him as a cover, which he has only
to complete rapidly. Each man then enlarges his shelter so as
to accommodate near comrades.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first wave, reformed at the assaulting distance, makes the
assault as before. At times, the losses and the confusion of units
may lead to an assault by entire companies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second and third waves follow and imitate the movements
of the first.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><em>Machine Guns and Light Cannon.</em></h4>

<p class='c011'>The artillery can only give the second line a support which is
often partial and not very effective; its action must be replaced
at whatever cost by other means, such as machine guns for sweeping
the hostile firing line and light cannon to instantly destroy
the hostile machine guns.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Location of the Machine-Gun and Gun Crews during the Assault.</em>—These
detachments follow the last waves of the first line, and they
therefore are not directly taken under fire and can profit by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>indications of the fight of the first line and so be in a way to act
effectively when the second line comes into action.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Machine Guns.</em>—The machine gun is an element of attack and
the most terrible arm of close fighting. However, it is employed
in the attack only to man the positions taken or to support the
infantry elements from a distance. This is nonsense: to give it
such a rôle, one could never have trembled with rage and impotence
at a few paces from the enemy, whom he could not get at.</p>

<p class='c007'>The machine gun should be pushed as far as possible in front
of the halted line of fire. If it remains behind or abreast of the
fighting line, its field of fire is generally blocked or masked by the
slightest movement; in advance of the line, it will enable the
infantry line to advance for some time under the cover of its fire;
it is the tooth of the attack. It can move forward, its crew of a
few men can creep along the smallest pathway, and a shell hole
is sufficient for its shelter; in the skirmish chain a whole ditch is
necessary. Will it lack ammunition, having only the boxes
that the gun crew carries sometimes incomplete? No, for it has
only to fire on rare occasions, for example, at the moment of
assault. If it is taken, what does that matter—we will take ten
from the enemy. The problem would be much simplified <em>with a
few automatic rifles</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Light Cannon.</em>—We have spoken of the rôle of light cannon
in the paragraph relating to the destruction of machine guns.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><em>Instruction of Units of the Second Line.</em></h4>

<p class='c011'>This instruction proposes to create the reflex of immediately
attacking all resistance that appears and of developing presence
of mind by inventing sudden incidents requiring the taking of a
rapid decision. In a word, to add a spirit of prompt decision in
the troops of the second line to the irresistible <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élan</span></i> which one
tries to develop in all assaulting troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>The troops of the second line when facing a resistance should
have only one idea: to assault as soon as possible and for that
purpose to try to bring about the two following conditions:</p>

<p class='c007'><em>To create a sort of parallel of departure at assaulting distance</em>;</p>

<p class='c007'><em>To obtain superiority of fire by all means at their disposal.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>We will study by means of examples the two preceding cases
cited. Troops of the second line should know them by heart,
because all cases resemble them more or less.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span><em>First Case.</em>—We reach the first line, halted under cover at 150
metres from the enemy; this is a case of organizing a long-distance
assault.</p>

<p class='c007'>Attention should be focussed on the following points:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Reestablishment of Order and Calm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The line of cover is an extemporized parallel, the men are
crowded into uncomfortable positions, several units are mixed.
These are conditions likely to create disorder, the worst enemy of
the assault. Think well as long as you are under cover because
amid the bullets you march straight ahead without thinking.
Transmit simple indications from man to man and orders to the
chiefs of section by note.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have all cease firing except the best shots; firing unnerves and
distracts the noncommissioned officers and soldiers. On the
contrary, silence is at once a mark of order; it impresses the men
who collect themselves and make the appeal for a supreme resolution
to their inner selves.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Gaining Superiority of Fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>It can be obtained in the two following ways:</p>

<p class='c007'>The execution of an intense fire by the whole line;</p>

<p class='c007'>The execution of a slow, deadly, and precise fire by the best
shots, well concealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The men are under cover, consequently it is possible to avoid
the first plan, which is noisy and not particularly effective but
which circumstances beyond our control sometimes make necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The best shots are designated by the chiefs of section. They
construct masks in front of themselves, behind which they fire
obliquely, that is to say, under excellent conditions of security
and calm. They locate an adversary, keep aiming at him and
firing each time that he appears, and they go successively from
right to left. This method is very effective; the enemy does not
dare to fire any more, and it soon seems as if his trench were empty.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition if possible, get a small group to the front or on the
flank, who will protect a forward movement by their fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>3.  Execution of the Assault.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The first and second sections will move out under command
of Lieutenant X and will make a rush of 80 metres. Open fire
after the rush.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>The movement should be simultaneous and without warning
to the enemy; the following suggestions are made:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Prepare to rush, look toward Lieutenant X, hide your bayonets.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The movement having been executed by the first echelon and
fire opened, the second echelon rushes in its turn, aligned at a quick
pace, then at double time, and carries along the first.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the moment of the charge, each man rushes on the enemy
and fires if necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Second Case.</em>—The units of the first line have been stopped at
more than 200 metres from the enemy, say at 500 metres.</p>

<p class='c007'>Move forward, executing short, rapid rushes without firing, in
thin lines which are united at assaulting distance from the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The formation of successive lines for rushing is extremely
simple. The company having arrived at a sheltered line beyond
which extends an open space, the company commander commands:</p>

<p class='c007'>“In thin lines by half section, at 100 metres distance by short
rushes: 1st and 3d Sections, forward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He personally goes out with the first line to select the emplacement
where he will halt it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each of the 1st and 3d Sections sends out two squads (1, 3,
9, 11). The men immediately take 6 pace intervals. This
forms the first line, which is followed by a second, and so on,
the rushes of each line alternating with those of the preceding one.</p>

<p class='c007'>The construction of the parallel of departure is accomplished
as has been indicated above.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><em>Instruction of the Machine-Gun Sections.</em></h4>

<p class='c011'>The machine-gun sections should participate in the exercises
with the infantry. They should be accustomed to grasp the idea
of the situation rapidly and to replace the fire of the attacking
infantry either by taking a position in rear or on the flanks which
will permit them to fire up to the end of the action without being
hindered by the movement to the front, or by going squarely out
in advance of the halted line.</p>

<p class='c007'>This last case should be particularly studied; the Germans have
shown it to us, and it is therefore possible; I know that it is very
effective (25th of August at Crevic).</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore train them to get used to picking out cover, however
insignificant, as a position for a machine gun and to utilize the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>ground skilfully and rush rapidly with the matériel in order to
make themselves invisible or indiscernible;</p>

<p class='c007'>To arrange shelter rapidly, to create a mask in front, and arrange
for oblique fire, in order that the personnel may not be rapidly
destroyed;</p>

<p class='c007'>To keep still and try to be forgotten until the moment of assault.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crews of the light guns should be attached to the infantry
and learn to cooperate with it instead of being independent.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><em>Exercises to Develop the Spirit of Decision in the Second Line.</em></h4>

<p class='c011'>In front of any resistance whatever, the units of the second line
should have but two ideas:</p>

<p class='c007'>To take positions rapidly for the assault;</p>

<p class='c007'>To assault.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dispositions for the assault are:</p>

<p class='c007'>The creation or adaptation of a line of a shelter at assaulting
distance;</p>

<p class='c007'>The rapid gaining of superiority of fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the work of maneuver is reduced to the realization of these
two ideas. It is a question of applying in slightly varying circumstances
the two classic studies above indicated, and one should
know them perfectly.</p>

<p class='c007'>To develop presence of mind in the noncommissioned officers
and suppleness in the organization, situations analogous to those
formerly used on the drill ground such as, “Cavalry to the right—in
rear” should be devised.</p>

<p class='c007'>Choose a parallel of departure and have the troops of the second
line take their formation and march on the objectives designated
in advance. Suddenly call out, “Enemy resistance on such a
line, our first elements are stopped at such a point ... hostile
machine guns in such a region.” Then everybody, infantry,
machine guns, light canon, instantly take up their dispositions.</p>

<p class='c007'>By representing the enemy and having him fire blank cartridges,
one becomes accustomed to making rapid reconnaissance of resistances.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>IV.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Preparation of the Troops for Penetration.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The battle of today, since the last evolution of the war, is only
a succession of assaults. The assault being the hardest and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>most murderous phase of the combat, before which the attack
generally breaks down, we should only undertake it with assaulting
troops. All troops are far from being assaulting troops; they need
a well established cohesion and a special training.</p>

<p class='c007'>In nine months of campaign, I have only twice had a company
really capable of delivering the assault: that of the active regiment,
which was eager to charge at whatever cost at Morhange, and
that of Neuville-Saint-Vaast, toward which during the assault,
I turned but twice—when we started and when I fell.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THE COHESION.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In order that an organization may be capable of reaching the
enemy, it is necessary for each man to be thoroughly convinced
that his neighbor will march at his side and not abandon him;
he should not have to turn around to see whether his comrade is
coming. This requires a solidly established cohesion. Cohesion
is very difficult to obtain with the continual renewal of men and
noncommissioned officers; to cement it well, the men must have
lived long together and have borne the same hardships during
which are strengthened the sentiments of solidarity and affection
which create in the company invisible bonds, stronger than all
discipline and the only ones capable of resisting the fierce egoism
of the battlefield.</p>

<p class='c007'>The company must also have been tried out by experiences
severe enough for everyone to be able to estimate what his leaders
and neighbors are worth under circumstances where borrowed
masks fall off. Thus habit, friendship, and confidence make no
difference in the appearance of a company; it is the battle alone
that unveils these qualities in their full staunchness and value.</p>

<p class='c007'>The company of the 9th of May had been in existence at least
four months, that is, the last considerable reinforcements had
been present about four months. We had indeed received newer
recruits, but they were not sufficient to change the spirit of the
company. We had lived in the Belgian trench where the material
side of the situation could not have been more miserable. Without
having suffered serious losses, we had been at times very roughly
used, so that all the men had an idea of the trials of war.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus trench life is an excellent school for cohesion, but a company
which moves forward directly from trench life would not be
capable of attacking as we should like. Trench life is deteriorating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and destroys in the mind of the man the idea that he belongs to a
unit, to an organization. It should be completed by a period of
exercises.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the period of exercises, the work should be toward
cohesion by establishing an exact discipline, difficult to obtain in
the trenches, by punctually requiring the marks of respect, and
by paying close attention to the uniform and personal appearance.
All these details have a prime moral importance; nothing is more
demoralizing for the soldier than to see around him his comrades
badly dressed and negligent in their duty; he evidently finds at
times that this is more convenient but at heart he lacks confidence
because he well knows that in this troop of Bohemians, without
faith or order, everyone will go his own way in the moment of
danger. The daily aspect of a company, carefully uniformed and
well disciplined, gives him, on the contrary, a feeling of reassurance
and confidence.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This is what our battalion commander often quoted to us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Combat exercises by entire units, close-order drill, and passing
in review which should always close an exercise session, contribute
to develop the sentiment, which becomes blunted in the
trenches, that the soldier belongs to a unit, compact and articulate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trench produces cohesion in the <em>small group</em>, the period of
exercise the <em>cohesion in the organization</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THE OFFENSIVE SPIRIT.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In order to rush headlong at the enemy out in the open, where
at any moment shot and shell may do its worst, one must have an
exuberance of energy. This increase of courage exists only among
troops who have for a long time been able to accumulate reserves
of moral force. A unit that has recently made a bloody effort is
incapable of delivering a <em>furious and unlimited assault</em>, such as we
wish for. It might with trouble take a line of trenches and there
hastily take cover. The supply of energy is used up quickly and
comes back very slowly; the memory of the terrible dangers must be
dulled. In a combat, the expenditure of energy is at once physical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>and nervous, but rather nervous than physical. Now the
mistake is often made of thinking that an organization is in
fighting condition when it has again taken on a good appearance
and seems in excellent form. A few nights of sleep and a few days
of good food are sufficient to restore the physique, but the nerve
cells are reformed with all the slowness that is characteristic of
them. How many times, some days after bloody fights which
have left me weak and emaciated, have I found myself in a state
of flourishing health almost shameful for a soldier, and felt at the
same time a faltering courage at heart!</p>

<p class='c007'>To try to attack with troops already dejected or insufficiently
recovered is to march to meet a certain and bloody defeat. It is
sufficient to see the troops with which the attempts to break
through at Neuville in the month of June were made and their
result, known in advance by the discouraged officers. The almost
destroyed regiments that had made the magnificent attacks of
May 9 and had occupied the conquered ground under the worst
bombardments until the 25th, had been reorganized with dispirited
officers and noncommissioned officers, and were the sorriest soldiers
that one could see—men recalled after having been formerly
rejected, incompletely instructed, and of rather mediocre spirit.
The few survivors of the splendid days of May, instead of being
exalted by the memory of these exploits, had retained the memory
of the massacre which had left them almost alone among their
former officers and two hundred comrades. Two weeks rest and
a new attack with the painful result which covered the famous
regiments with unmerited shame; companies hesitating to leave
their trenches, officers obliged to drive their men, the slaughter of
abandoned noncommissioned officers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore do not attack except with troops that have not made
a bloody effort for a long time and who have been able to recuperate
their supply of energy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second condition under which troops attack without
thought of sparing themselves is when they truly feel that the
action in which they are going to engage is worth the immense
sacrifice of life. Each man down to the most humble feels conscious
that his existence is of inestimable value, that it represents
many efforts, many troubles, and many affections. The infantry
soldier has so many and many occasions to die that he only gives
himself up to it on real occasions, and this calm and conscientious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>self-denial which irritates those who would like to find the troops
ever responsive to their orders is of a supreme grandeur. When
one has seen the death and suffering of the soldier at close range, one
ties to him as to one’s self and does not expose him for every whim.
The soldier understands this thoroughly, and when he is told that
it is “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour la Patrie</span></i>,” he then goes in for all he is worth, and so it
is that the chief who has not stormed and fumed in vain is rewarded
for his wisdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coming of the generals who know how to talk to the men
who will meet their death with simplicity and conviction, has a
profound and decisive influence on the open-hearted mass of
infantrymen. Handling soldiers was formerly the greatest accomplishment
of commanders, who did not confine themselves to the
brief and abstract formulas of their orders. <em>Today as formerly,
the word of the great chief, rational and assured, is graven in
ineffaceable letters in the hearts of the combatants.</em> Beyond the
chief, the soldier clearly sees his native country, whose supreme
will still claims the sacrifice, and in himself he feels his courage
harden.</p>

<p class='c007'>Toward the 15th of April, returning from Belgium, our regiment
passed in review before General F—, our former Corps Commander,
who assembled the officers and said to them: “We are going to
attempt another maneuver&nbsp;..., the waiting has come to an end,
we are going after them ..., we have today cannon and ammunition
in abundance, we will crush their shelters, we will destroy
their machine guns.... Then the infantry will be launched and
will crush them; after the first ones, there will be others ...,
then others ...; if we do not succeed, we shall have no one to
blame but ourselves.” These words sank into the hearts of the
company officers, and they repeated them with conviction to their
soldiers, and the latter heard them so well that they surpassed all
that could have been expected; they are not the ones whom
General F— might blame.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the troops see clearly the object, but the moral preparation
would be insufficient if the man felt himself incapable of
accomplishing it. Each day the officers should instil in the
troops the idea of the effort and show them how it may be realized;
there are even questions concerning the instinct of preservation
that it is well to bring into play. Thus instead of fearing the
ordeal, the man little by little gets accustomed to the idea of
facing it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>It remains now to complete and exalt the offensive spirit by an
intense period of appropriate exercises. Trench life has a tendency
to kill the offensive spirit of the troops. They think only of protecting
themselves, they are always under cover, they circulate in the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaux</span></i>, and all this creates a horror of the open ground. Daily
experiences, such as not being able to show one’s head without
running the risk of receiving a bullet in the face, create a very
acute sensation of danger. They dare no longer stir, and to attack
the terrible trenches of the enemy which one cannot look at even
for a second seems a mad and irrealizable project. The service in
the trenches creates terror of the hostile trench.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><em>The Man Must Be Put into Forward Movement</em></h4>

<p class='c011'>Make him run, jump, and rush in the open spaces; let him get
intoxicated with air and movement; the attitude creates the
mentality. As soon as he has lost the habit of hanging his head
and hunching his back, he has also lost his exaggerated prudence
and the fear of unsheltered spaces.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the cantonments at Fiefs and Berles, where we passed a
fortnight before the 9th of May, the afternoons were entirely
given up to sport. We organized “field days” in the woods,
obstacle races, and the men, recruits and old reservists, galloped
through these spring days with absolutely unbounded animation.
To give the men the habit of moving without anxiety over open
ground where the bullets whistled, I took advantage of the nights
when we were working on saps and parallels to make them march
in patrols a short distance in front of the lines. If I saw that the
workmen were thinking of crouching down, I made them stand up
for a while; as for me, I fortified myself by walking up and down in
front of the working party.</p>

<p class='c007'>We wished for an irresistible assault and therefore tried to inculcate
in the men the instinct of hand-to-hand fighting, at which
they ordinarily hesitate with the result that the close combat is
stopped for days and months at a few score metres from the
enemy. We had bayonet fencing, but it was a demoniacal fencing,
the fencing of the chargers of Froeschwiller.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fencing exercises, carried out by the company to prepare
for the attack, were as follows: first, a brief review of the movements,
then immediately fencing on the run; the men were formed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>at a few paces intervals and then started on a run; it was “Halt!
Thrust! Thrust again!” They started again, climbed the embankments,
lunged and relunged furiously; they got winded, so
much the worse.... “Right face!” and everyone ran to the
right, descended the slope stabbing and stabbing again, getting
excited and feverish, the officers and sergeants galloping more
furiously than the rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Afterwards fencing with the dummy. We had stuffed sacks
full of straw and made them smaller each day to make a smaller
target and oblige the men to be more accurate in their thrusts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each man attacked the dummy individually, shouting with all
the frenzy of which his imagination was capable, and those who
attacked the best, with the greatest <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élan</span></i>, went over it again to
show their comrades how to do it. It was no play, they knew
enough of the Germans to believe them in front of them, and I
recall that among those from Gascony, Toulouse, and Provence,
who formed the basis of the company, some shouted with frenzy,
“Piquo, Piquo!”</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to give more movement, the exercise against the
dummy was arranged in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c007'>In a quite tangled wood, we established obstacles by cutting down
bushes over a course of 80 metres. Then here and there we placed
the dummies. Thus on a fairly short course the man was obliged
to run, jump, bend down, attack, and this in every manner, for
we placed the dummies in such a way that the man had to combine
his attack with right face, left face, face to the rear, or with crossing
an obstacle. This exercise particularly interested the men, and
as we measured the time taken by each one to run the course, in a
few days it had developed in an astonishing manner their agility
and suppleness, and gave nerve to those who had none. I know
that as concerns myself the knowledge of having covered the course
in the shortest time, in addition to other experiences, contributed
greatly to developing my confidence in my vigor and my good legs,
which were the most precious of my offensive qualities on the 9th
of May.</p>

<p class='c007'>Afterwards we attacked in groups and then passed to charges
by section. Here we sought, while giving the greatest impulsion
and fury possible, to maintain cohesion and give to each one the
confidence of the touch of elbows, and to the enemy the terrifying
impression of a wall that nothing could stop. We marched at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>charging pace,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a> aligned, with a lengthened and furious step—not
restrained and without conviction—up to 50 metres; then we
charged, lowering the bayonets in a single movement to the height
of the waist.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were working to get the charge of the skirmishers and
Zouaves at Froeschwiller; now we have had it with loss of the
majority of our officers over three successive trenches on two
kilometres of a single rush to the cemetery of Neuville-Saint-Vaast.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>V.<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Material Preparation of the Troops.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The fight does not consist in getting killed but in getting out of
it by thrashing the enemy. Therefore do not go at it in a hurly-burly
fashion; one should be careless only about the inevitable
fatality over which one can have no influence. Let us prepare
our business down to the slightest details in order to conquer and
live.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>KNOWLEDGE OF THE GROUND.</h3>

<h4 class='c012'><em>Maps.</em></h4>

<p class='c011'>Before the attack, the physiognomy of the terrain and of the
enemy’s defenses should be well impressed on the memory. The
position should be known not only from the front but in profile.
This study is of the greatest importance, particularly <em>for the troops
of the second line</em>, because the greatest cause of stoppage in an
offensive against a fortified position is the incomplete knowledge
of the position. One is afraid, in advancing, of falling into an ambush.
The company commanders, particularly those of the first line,
should indicate to their chiefs of section the successive points of
direction for their sections, so that each one will be aware of the
obstacles he will have to cross. The men should likewise know
the ground well. I used to require them to study the future
sector of attack, giving them the principal points to watch when
they went on guard in the trench.</p>

<p class='c007'>If on the 4th of December we had known the terrain of attack
before the night engagement instead of not having the slightest
notion of it, we would not have awaited the dawn at the first German
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>trench for fear of falling into a wasps’ nest, and we should
have taken not only the second but the third trench and made
many prisoners.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very detailed maps are distributed before the attack to company
commanders and to chiefs of section, but one should try to
complete them oneself by attentive and repeated observation
of one’s sector. Before the attack of the 9th of May, I had
recopied for each noncommissioned officer the part of my map
concerning the zone of attack of the company, entering on it all
known information.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Matériel.</span></i></h4>

<p class='c011'>Real superiority over the enemy is obtained by superiority of
weapons; courage cannot make up for destruction, one must tax
one’s brain to furnish the men with matériel which may be useful
to them.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Grenades.</em>—Every grenadier or member of a patrol should carry
five grenades; each man should have one, not to throw himself
but so that it may be possible to get a certain number of them
together in case of need. If a fight with grenades is foreseen in a
region cut up with trenches or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaux</span></i> or in a town, the supply
should be increased.</p>

<p class='c007'>Furnish suffocating grenades, especially to patrols going into
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaux</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Familiarize everyone a long time beforehand, if possible, with
the handling of the different grenades. On the 8th of May, I
sent 5 kilometres for suffocating grenades, which I had just heard
of, in order to be acquainted with the effects of this useful weapon.
Have hooks prepared, fixed to the left wrist, for the purpose of
lighting the friction grenades by hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Revolvers and knives are indispensable for the fight in the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaux</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have individual sand bags to establish a rapid barrier in the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaux</span></i> or to build up a line of cover such as we have before described.</p>

<p class='c007'>Also the Filloux apparatus, with the use of which the men should
be familiar.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Equipment.</em>—Keep the lightened knapsack, which will be of
service against a possible bombardment of the conquered position
(lesson of Langemark, December 4). Fold the blanket on the
inside of the knapsack to form a padding against fragments.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c010'>ACTION OF THE FIRST LINE OF ATTACK.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The artillery preparation, roaring on the horizon like a furious
storm, ceases sharply, and a tragic silence falls over the field of
battle. The infantry leaves its parallels in a single movement,
at a walk, magnificently aligned, crowned with the scintillation of
thousands of bayonets. Then the hostile trenches burst out
suddenly with fire, the fusillade rattles immediately, madly,
dominated by the pitiless rattling of the machine guns. The
wave of assailants thins out, entire units disappear, mowed down.
Some lie down and advance no further, while others, better commanded,
march ahead in spite of all. Some, more favored, find
themselves in places where the artillery preparation has cleared
the enemy out. They reach the first trench, and hand-to-hand
fighting commences.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second wave arrives in its turn, avoids the zone of destruction,
plunges into the parts where the resistance has weakened,
and thus the first trench, split up into enveloped sections, is
definitely submerged by the second wave. They form beyond the
captured trench and start forward again; but it is a disorganized
combat by groups in the midst of shots and bullets which cross
each other in every direction. The second trench is assaulted,
certain parts are conquered through which the flood of assailants
spreads out while desperate groups resist stubbornly in some
redoubts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now in the first line of attack, there is no more order, the dead
cover the ground passed over, here mowed down by ranks, there
hung in clusters on the wire entanglements, or forming a crown
on top of the parapets, or sown here and there by the scattering
of the hand-to-hand fights; the wounded flow back in numbers to
the rear, isolated soldiers are scattered in all corners for the most
diverse reasons; even organizations are stopped in the conquered
trenches by their chiefs who find that they have done enough and
that it is high time to get out of the trouble. But beyond this
immense dispersion, some heroic groups, weak nuclei of many
companies, led by ardent leaders, make their way further into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>hostile territory. They suddenly appear, urged into a gallop over
the trenches; magnified ten times by the imagination of the
enemy who loses his head, they run beyond into the open fields,
receiving some shots here and there but surprised at the emptiness
of the field of battle. Behind them, the combat of extermination
continues in places, but nothing follows, only some groups of
stragglers and wounded are returning. Then these foremost
parties feel their weakness and count their numbers; the emptiness,
the silence, the invisible resistance impress them, they scent the
ambush and soon stop.</p>

<p class='c007'>In front of the centers of resistance, the fight is hard and murderous;
they have taken one or two trenches, carried the first
houses, but the organizations are dissolved in the interminable
individual fighting in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boyaux</span></i> or ruins; here the progress has
been inappreciable in spite of enormous losses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the first line has made its effort; in the centers of resistance,
it has scarcely gotten a good hold on the exterior borders; in the
intervals, on the contrary, it has expanded widely like a wave
which had broken through a dike at one point. But it has been
stopped, out of breath, in front of the second line of defense,
whose resistance is organizing, or it has been nailed to its place
by flanking fire from the still unconquered centers of resistance;
it is composed from now on of weak groups of real fighters, just
strong enough to mark out here and there the limits of the conquered
ground, and of a multitude of isolated individuals and
entire units which are scattered over the whole zone of attack.</p>

<p class='c007'>This has all lasted perhaps less than an hour.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ACTION OF THE SECOND LINE OF ATTACK.</h3>

<p class='c011'>With the enemy all is disorder, the batteries flee at a gallop
before the tide which has carried away all the obstacles prepared
long ago and judged impregnable; all confidence disappears; the
adversary, feeling his resistance giving way around him, no
longer dares to hold out desperately, from now on the least thing
induces him to turn tail. However, at some points reserves
have come up, have manned their positions of the second line,
and have attempted some timid offensive returns. Machine guns,
rapidly brought up, are installed and fire with utmost rapidity to
prevent access to the undefended zones and to gain time. The
tottering resistance tries to hold on; now, one more great brutal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>push along the whole front like the attack of the first line, and
then will come a total rout.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is then that the second line appears; starting out in its turn
from the parallel, it advances by immense and successive waves
of thin lines, calm and unshakable among the rafales of shells and
random bullets.</p>

<p class='c007'>Already numerous detachments of machine guns and light cannon
have preceded it. Creeping through, following up the first
line, they have been able to unravel the situation and to discern
the points where the resistance tries to hold out and which must
be immediately swept. The light cannon orient themselves
directly on the rattling of the machine guns, which they endeavor
to overwhelm with a shower of their small shells.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “accompanying batteries” have started as soon as the
first trenches are taken and are soon oriented by the signals of the
special <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agents de liaison</span></i>, artillerists who follow the infantry. The
remainder of the artillery cuts off the approaches by a barrier of
asphyxiating shells and carries its fire on to the second line, marked
out according to the directing plan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the second line arrives close up to the advanced elements
of the first line under cover of sufficient fire. The second line
pushes straight to the front on the objectives fixed long before
and which should claim its whole attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>Certain of the units have a mission to blind the centers of
resistance by finishing up the conquest of their exterior borders,
while the great majority are absorbed in the intervals, instead of
halting and exhausting themselves by playing the enemy’s game
in his inextricable points of support.</p>

<p class='c007'>To quote an expression of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,”
modifying it slightly: a center of resistance is a filter into which
one can pour battalions and regiments, and it will yield only a
few drops.</p>

<p class='c007'>The organizations passing through the intervals arrive in front
of the second line of defense, which is not generally occupied
continuously. They run against lively and sudden resistances,
or <em>else encounter empty spaces through which they boldly penetrate</em>,
pushing straight on always to the front without being intimidated
by the silence or distracted by the resistance on the right or left.
The units stopped rapidly organize the assault and attack by main
force like the first waves of the attack without trying to maneuver,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>a temptation of weakness and indecision. Here again there is
hesitation: units held up by only a semblance of resistance or
trying to avoid it; others, having approached to assaulting distance,
dig in and dare not go forward openly into a supreme charge;
others are turned away from their objective to get into another
combat, which absorbs them.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, the second line of hostile defense finds itself in its
turn disabled; broken in and considerably passed by in certain
localities, vigorously assailed on all points where a resistance is
hastily improvized, it is soon split up into islands and surrounded
on all sides.</p>

<p class='c007'>The points of support, as in the case of the first trench, are left
to one side and merely isolated by the capture of their borders.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ACTION OF THE RESERVES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>We are now nearly in open ground; we must still definitely clear
away the last resistance to which the hostile reinforcements now
coming up in haste would cling and soon convert into an insuperable
barrier if we give them a few hours’ respite.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is for this purpose that we employ the reserves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Informed by officers of <em>liaison</em>, who are not afraid to traverse
the battlefield to find out how things are going on and who do
not abandon the troops to their own resources until tardy reports
come in, the superior commander directs his reserves to the precise
points where they are most needed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the last resistances, which the second attacking line, occupied
with marching straight ahead, was not able to encircle, are
definitely shattered by the reserves.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><em>Exploitation of the Success.</em></h4>

<p class='c011'>Finally, we have arrived in the zone of open country, the gigantic
assault of 5 or 6 kilometres is ended. Now it will be the surprise,
the rapidity of movements, the skill of maneuver which
will gradually produce panic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy, pushed back, overthrown, broken through in the
intervals between the points of support where he tries to hold on,
will soon no longer find a position where he dare make a stand;
he will be irresistibly drawn into the rout as the menacing cry
“the French!” re-echoes in an infinitely increasing volume.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it will then no longer be a question of breaking through, we
must rest after the assault.</p>

accomplished will the second line, complete in itself, like the first line assault
over the same ground, each unit as in the first line having a pre-arranged
objective; this second line not to be used by the superior commander for any
but the preconceived program. Behind this second line are held as reserve
other bodies of troops under the direct orders of the superior commander for
employment against any resistance that the first and second lines have failed
to take. Behind all this are the general reserves, several hours in rear, ready

filled with the companies detailed for the assault, and as the artillery ceases,
the waves rush in succession up the ladders and to the front. Thus the name

only the parallel, but the saps and the main trenches are filled with men who
move up into the parallel as fast as room is made.—<span class='sc'>Translator.</span></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
